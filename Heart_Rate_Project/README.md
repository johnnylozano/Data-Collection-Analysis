# Heart Rate Project
Project with collaboration from Tanim Choudhury where a Raspberry Pi 3B+ was used in conjunction with a heart rate sensor MAX30102 to measure heart rate and SpO2 in the human body. The data was sent to an AWS IoT Cloud platform where the data was extracted in .csv format and analyzed with Python.
